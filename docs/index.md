# Welcome to Memoirs of a Systems Engineer

The purpose of this blog is to be used as a personal dairy to reference back solutions for problems that I've encountered at work or when doing personal projects, although I secretly hope to have an audience that resonates with the information presented or that finds this site when looking for a solution for a problem presented at work or something.

The idea of writing a blog has been prevalent as I've wanted to convey a message to people struggling with programming related topics (see the first conception of this idea in my old blog https://dblinkzzprogrammingjourney.blogspot.com/) but never really got a clear picture of how to conceptualize what I had in my head, so a second version of the blog came after, and was later scrapped and so this version came into existance, something minimalistic with the sole focus of putting information that I've had in my head on the internet. I figured by simple statistics, there should be more guys like myself out there that might find some of the lectures interesting, and that's a nice to have, but the main goal is to keep my experiences in a tangible place and also to exercise my passion for writing and explaining things as if I was talking to someone.
