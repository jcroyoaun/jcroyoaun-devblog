# Welcome to Memoirs of a Systems Engineer

The purpose of this blog is to be used as a personal dairy to reference back solutions for problems that I've encountered at work or when doing personal projects, although I secretly hope to have an audience that resonates with the information presented or that finds this site when looking for a solution for a problem presented at work or something.

The idea of writing a blog has been prevalent as I've wanted to convey a message to people struggling with programming related topics (see the first conception of this idea in my old blog https://dblinkzzprogrammingjourney.blogspot.com/) but never really got a clear picture on how to go on with it, so ultimately I decided to keep a diary for myself and hope that someone else might find it useful.
